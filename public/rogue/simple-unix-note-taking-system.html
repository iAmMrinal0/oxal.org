<p>Some people love taking notes. They love trying out everything there is about how to take notes. They write their own note taking software, hate it, and then write it again. It’s a life long journey. Wiki, dream logs, journals, dear diary, personal twitter feed; we want <strong>everything</strong>. Is it too much to ask?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Software, as long as you can do something about it, should posses the faculty of being intuitive to use. As soon as it crosses that fine barrier of elementary goodness, it starts to get in your way. So naturally I <em>try</em> to make everything I use as simple as possible and then I never have to think about it again.</p>
<p>That means I simply can not be a fan boy. Nope. Although I love using the command line for everything, it’s simply not the best tool for every job, and certainly not the easiest.</p>
<p>Regardless, it works plenty fine for taking notes. Because what are notes anyways?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking notes is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated. -<em>Confucius</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man, Confucius surely was ahead of his time.</p>
<p>Notes are just text files. Daily journaling? Text again. Todo lists? Text. Wiki? Text. So let’s just keep it that way and write everything in text files.</p>
<h2 id="ox-text-file-saving-system">ox text file saving system</h2>
<p>Let’s dive deep into how to write, save and edit text files.</p>
<h3 id="decide-a-place-to-store-your-text-files.">Decide a place to store your text files.</h3>
<p>Best place would be dropbox since it takes care of syncing and backups and you never have to think about it ever again.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/Dropbox/cabinet/notes
# I like to collect certain things inside a &quot;cabinet&quot;
# The cabinets tale will have to wait for now</code></pre>
<h3 id="categorise-your-text-files-into-folders.">Categorise your text files into folders.</h3>
<pre><code>JOURNAL=$CABINET/journal
NOTES=$CABINET/notes

<h3 id="allow-easy-access-to-text-files-in-those-folders">Allow easy access to text files in those folders</h3>
<p>It’s time to make writing, saving, and editing process as streamlined as possible. Keep it simple silly, remember?</p>
<h4 id="daily-text-files."><strong>Daily text files.</strong></h4>
<p>Files which make sense only for a given day are the easiest to handle. Name them with a date and they’re good to go.</p>
<pre><code>oxdiary () {
    $EDITOR $CABINET/journal/diary/$(date +%F).md
}

oxdream () {
    $EDITOR $CABINET/journal/diary/$(date +%F).md
}</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>oxdiary</code> simply creates a new entry in my diary folder with todays date, and if the file exists it opens the existing file and I can add my thoughts to it.</p>
<p>I can also give them a name with the time and they start recording your activity/thoughts at any given moment.</p>
<pre><code>oxantisocial () {
    $EDITOR $CABINET/journal/antisocial/$(date +%FT%H:%M).md
}</code></pre>
<h4 id="text-files-with-an-intent-and-a-context-notes.">Text files with an intent, and a context: <strong>NOTES</strong>.</h4>
<p>Since notes need more <em>organising</em> than a daily entry, we need to get a bit creative.</p>
<p>First, we need easy access to the notes directory and a scratch pad where we can offload our minds.</p>
<pre><code>alias nt=&#39;cd $NOTES&#39;

# Edit scratch pad note
# npad (note-pad) and epad (edit-pad) both aliases are
# used to edit the scratch pad.
alias epad=&quot;$EDITOR $NOTES/scratch-pad.md&quot;
alias npad=&quot;$EDITOR $NOTES/scratch-pad.md&quot;

# cpad is used to cat the scratch pad when you quickly feel like 
# seeing the contents but dont want to edit, or perhaps use it
# in a command like `cpad | pbcopy` to copy its contents
alias cpad=&quot;cat /NOTES/scratch-pad.md&quot;

# ppad is the path to the file, just incase you need it 
# for scripting eg. `grep TODO ppad`
# or `pbpaste &gt;&gt; ppad`
alias ppad=&quot;$NOTES/scratch-pad.md&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now one of the major features of note taking software is their ability to clip content from the web. I wanted to find the easiest way I could think of to save website content, or some random reddit comment I stumble upon, so I went straight back to <code>Ctrl + C</code>.</p>
<p><code>nsnip</code>: Note snip instantly copies the content of your clipboard and saves it to a file.</p>
<pre><code># Create snippet
nsnip() {
    # pbpaste and pbcopy should be mapped to xlcip on linux in zshrc
    local content=pbpaste
    local genname=`pbpaste | head -c 25`
    local filename=${@:-$genname}
    local slug=`echo $filename | sed &#39;s|\ |_|g&#39; | sed &#39;s|[_]*$||&#39;`
    $content &gt;&gt; $NOTES/snips/$(date +%F)-${slug}.md
    echo &quot;\n&quot; &gt;&gt; $NOTES/snips/$(date +%F)-${slug}.md
}</code></pre>
<p>It’s best explained with an example:</p>
<pre><code>/c/notes ❯❯❯ cat &lt;&lt; w00t | pbcopy
pipe &gt; Let&#39;s copy some stuff into our clipboard.
pipe &gt; This can simply be done by Ctrl + C, but
pipe &gt; I am using the command line to look more
pipe &gt; l337.
pipe &gt; w00t

# now simply type the command nsip and see what happens
/c/notes ❯❯❯ nsnip
/c/notes ❯❯❯ cd $NOTES/snips
/c/n/snips ❯❯❯ ls -t | head -n 2
2017-01-27-Let&#39;s_copy_some_stuff_int.md</code></pre>
<p>There you go, a file with todays name and the first 25 chars of your clipboard has been saved. You can even provide a custom name with an argument.</p>
<p>Finally comes the actual notes. For note creating, and over all searching of all notes, journals, logs, dairy entries etc happens with the help of two programs.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>fzf - fuzzy finder</li>
<li>ag - the silver searcher</li>
</ol>
