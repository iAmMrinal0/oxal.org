Easy, quick and healthy dish to make if you have some leftover rice. Mom made it for us the other day.

1. Put a little olive oil in a pan.
2. Cut and add the following veggies:
    - Spring onions (small round cuts)
    - Carrots (long cuts like finger chips)
    - Peas
    - American corn
    - Mushrooms
3. Add salt, pepper and red chilli powder.
4. Cover the pan and let it heat for a while
5. Add normal steamed (or boiled) white rice.
6. Mix and serve.

Sorry forgot to take a picture, but it was pretty tasty.
