## My story

I wanted to become an ordinary human. But due to unfortunate
circumstances I was forced to live my life as a rogue. I trained and
developed ninshu, which led me to greater understanding of the world
around me.\
I publish the learnings of my hard training at
[computableverse.com](http://computableverse.com). I also publish rough
notes over at [oxal.org/blog](/blog)

## weapons

In some part of the multiverse, a great master once said

> If your mind is not projected into your hands, even ten thousand
> techniques are useless.

I've learnt to use a lot of tools and weapons on my path to the ultimate
mastery. Some I've borrowed, some I've created. All of those are stashed
here: [oxal.org/projects](/projects)
