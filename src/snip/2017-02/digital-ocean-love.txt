Support Request Created 9 months ago
Student credit expiration. Need some digital love.

Since the hint in the support ticket textarea field says to 'Describe the
problem in great detail', here it goes. (Skip the next 2 paragraphs to get to
the point) 

I started venturing into the world of web development back almost a year ago. I
tried out an uncountable number of 'free hosting' providers in the small hope
that I can get my crappy code published onto the internet for my friends, and
family to see. Rest assured, I failed miserably.

I then heard about GitHub Student Pack, which offered credit for a new cloud
hosting platform I had never heard of (I only knew about free ones back then).
I spinned up a server and was introduced to this amazing world of DIY cloud
computing, which I never knew existed. I learnt a lot from it and deployed my
personal apps, notification servers, personal website all on it. It all worked
like a charm, and obviously I started recommending all my friends to try out
DigitalOceans awesomeness ;)

But unfortunately, I just saw an email stating that over $55 worth of my
student credit will expire in the next few days (3 days). I never needed more
than a Tier-0 ($5) droplet for my teeny bit of use. 

I'd be lying if I said I haven't enjoyed and appreciated your service all these
months, but right now, as a broke student in India, it would be really tough
for me to gather $5 every month simply to host my website. 

So I request you for an extension on the credit is possible, or if I could
pre-pay for 11 months of my currently $5 droplet which is deployed, or any
other sort of assistance DigitalOcean can provide me. 

Thank you
Kind regards
Mitesh Shah.
