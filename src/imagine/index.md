This column is an amalgamation of ten parts smug, and ten
parts crazy resulting in an inconsequential list of lengthy
ramblings. Views are subject to change. Take everything
written here with a quark of salt. You've been warned. 

<!--You've been warned again; you're not even supposed to
be here. This link is not for you. But since you've
found it somehow. Well. Enjoy (and drop me a message
of how you found it. I'd be happy to hear it!)-->
<!-- I had this warning a long time back when I kept my
blog hidden in plainsight. Now it's public, so I am commenting
it for the curious viewer -->
