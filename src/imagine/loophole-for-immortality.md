So I just read a question of /r/AskReddit: []()

Before reading any of the replies, I wanted to try
and think hard for this one. It really piqued my 
interest and so I'm going to think this through.

Before we take a look at some of the loopholes, it's 
best to try and think of

## Get hit by an aestroid which is atleast 1/4th the size of the 
   earth.

Probable? Definitely.

If it's a natural incident and we cannot destroy the
asteroid, all of us die anyways. I surely don't want
to be the last human alive. It'd be scary as hell.

But what if it's not a natural incident, and we have
an interstellar enemy trying to wipe us out?
 
What if in a million years we are a type 5 civilization
and every single being out there is finding a way to
end my immortality?
A type 5 civilization can definitely alter the path of a
pesky asteroid on an abadoned and drained out planet, or
even a dying star (I'm immortal so stars can't kill me
right?) and finish me off.

To be honest, there's no need to go to such extremes.
I could simply be chillin in my rogue falcon my systems
go down and I end up coliding with an asteroid. I'm dead.
WELP, *loopholes can have loopholes too*.

There are some more issues with this, but lets move
on for now.

## I can only be killed by an alien

It's the year 2100, the first man landed on Mars 2 months ago.
He's on his way back to earth. He lands today, and unkowingly
he carries an alien *virus* like form with him. It ends up
spreading and wipes out the entire humanity.

That was easy. Let's think harder.

The above 2 scenarios are giving the power to control my 
immortality in the hands of external factors. This is obviously
bad for a ton of reasons.

- I can't kill myself if I am being tortured for a gazillion
  years.
- I can't kil myself if I get trapped inside a black hole.
  Please, I have no intentions of being alive in nothingness
  for the rest of eternity. The thought itself kills me.
- I'm susceptiple to people finding out the loophole and
  finishing me off.
- Murphys law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

We want something which can be 
controlled by myself. But it can't be something I can be forced
into, like say for example "I die when I rip apart my 2 fingers and 1
toe with my mouth", I can be forced to do that, I may not have
enough teeth left, or a myriad of other things can again go
wrong.

So this narrows down to something *intrinsic*, something very
core to me being alive. But before exploring that, let's
take a look at some of the replies in that thread.

There have been a lot of answers which have aren't extremely
imporbable but are very easy to beat after like say a million
years of human and technologoical evolution. We want to steer
clear from these because we *truly* want to be immortal. Like
for example:

> I can be killed by my future self

Extremely probable. Your future self from 10000000000
gabijizillion years in the future want to commit suicide 
and he comes back in time and kills you and every single
copy that has this genie ask him in every single possible
dimension and every single possible multiverse the second they
wish that.

> 
in time and kills you that very second. (This assumes
